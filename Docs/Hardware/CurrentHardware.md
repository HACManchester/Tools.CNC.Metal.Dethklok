The branding is a CNCEST we think it's a variation of one of these

## Axis

  * There are 4 axis, 3 of them on the main machine which are driven by Nema23's.  
  * The axis appears to be on ball screws and not lead screws (which is a good thing).  

## Case Fan

The case Fan is 24V and takes 150mA.  
It can be fed from the main PSU.  
The Duet has a 2A fuse limit onboard.

## Spindle

  * The spindle appears to be a water cooled 800W powered by a VFD built into the main control box.  
  * The water cooling pump and a small led strip are powered by a 12V ATX PSU.

There are 3 pins used on the 5pin plug at the back for the spindle:

  * Pin 2 - U - Black
  * Pin 3 - V - Green
  * Pin 1 - W - Red

## Control Board

The main control board and stepper drivers have been replaced by a Duet Wifi.
